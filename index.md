## Research interests

I am interested in the application of machine learning techniques to wireless sensor networks. My research focuses on the design and implementation of software-defined wireless sensor networks (SDWSNs) and the application of machine learning techniques to improve the performance of SDWSNs. I am also interested in the application of machine learning techniques to other areas of wireless communications, such as the Internet of Things (IoT).
